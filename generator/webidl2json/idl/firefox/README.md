# Firefox webidl files

These .idl files (in the mozilla repo they end in .webidl) are used to auto-generate the JS bindings of the Firefox browser.
Note that we only cover the interfaces available to the web application code. There is a second interface available to the privileged JS code that is the Firfox browser chrome frontend.

They are located in [dom/webidl](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/webidl)
